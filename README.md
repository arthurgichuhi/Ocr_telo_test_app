Hello there, if you're on this repository you must be in search of the Optical Character Recognition App.
You're in the right place, so the code for the app is in this repository, its not under any share license but do what you want with it.
Anyways for those who just want to test out the app, its not available on any App Store at the moment but I do have an apk for android users,
